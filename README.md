## Inspiration
We wanted to make productivity *feel rewarding*. Pomodoro timers are great for focus, but they can feel sterile. Pawmodoro adds a digital companion that reacts to your progress; your pet stays happy when you stay consistent!  
Perfect for students, remote workers, and anyone who needs a friendly nudge to stay on track.

## Features
- **Pomodoro Timer:** Start/stop/reset cycles with customizable durations.
- **Virtual Pet:** Your companionâ€™s mood changes based on your focus streaks.
- **Task List:** Add, check off, and manage your to-dos directly in the popup.
- **Persistent Data:** Uses local storage to save your settings, streaks, and tasks.
- **Notifications & Badges:** Stay notified when your focus or break ends.
